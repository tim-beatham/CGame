# Square Survival

This week I learnt the C programming language and I used the new skills I gained to create a basic game using the raylib game
framework.

## Movement

The game is incredibly basic. The aim of the game is to simply survive as long as possible without dying. The you can move the player around with
the WASD keys. The player points towards the mouse. Pressing Left Click shoots a bullet, and pressing Z shoots all remaining bullets in one go.
The camer follows the player at a slower speed than the player itself making the game even more challenging.

## Parallax

I have implemented parallax in the game to give an appearance of depth. There are three layers: the foreground, the playing space and 
the background.
